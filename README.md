## Features
* three analog inputs
* three PWM outputs to drive an RGB LED based on the analog iputs
* two digital inputs for incrementing and resetting a counter
* interrupt handling on digital inputs using TMR0
* software switch debounce
* 4 bit counter 0-9 driven by digital inputs
* 4 digital outouts representing the value of the counter
